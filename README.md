### Hi, I'm Mark.

I'm a SMTS for math libraries at AMD.

Previously, I was an application engineer for the Ray Tracing++ Team at Intel. Prior to that, I was a research engineer at Qualcomm on the Graphics Research Team and a computer scientist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. I did in situ scientific visualization for HPC.
